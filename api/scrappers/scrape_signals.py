"""
Thread-safe side-channel for scrapers to flag a block/anomaly to the orchestrator.

Scrapers run deep in a nodriver worker thread and collapse every failure to ``[]`` or
an exception, so at the orchestrator a *block* (captcha / Cloudflare / no-feed) is
indistinguishable from a legitimately *empty* result. When a scraper detects a block it
calls :func:`note_block` with the captured HTML; the orchestrator consumes it with
:func:`pop_block` right after the scrape to classify the outcome and keep the HTML
snapshot for the admin monitoring page (reactive capture — no proactive probing).
