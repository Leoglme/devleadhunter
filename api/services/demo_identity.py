"""
Shared PostHog identity resolution for a prospect.

The demo slug is the identity used by demo-site tracking: ``useDemoTracking``
initialises PostHog with ``distinctID = slug``. Mirroring email events under the
SAME identity is what lets PostHog stitch the ``email → démo → vente`` funnel
onto a single person (and attach the demo session replay to it).

This module is the single source of truth for that mapping so the send path
(``email_sending_service``) and the Resend webhook (``webhooks``) always agree
on which ``distinct_id`` an email event carries.
