"""
Conversation service — the email thread between the user and a prospect.

Builds the chronological exchange (outbound sends + captured replies), tracks
which replies still await an answer (« à traiter »), and sends threaded answers
from the app (RFC ``In-Reply-To`` / ``References`` headers so the prospect's mail
client keeps the discussion in one thread).

Reply bodies are exposed as PLAIN TEXT only: inbound HTML is untrusted content —
it is stripped server-side rather than sanitized-and-rendered.
