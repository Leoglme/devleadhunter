"""
Campaign queue service — manages the cold-email send queue.

Responsibilities:
  - Enqueue initial (J1) and follow-up (J+N) emails when a campaign is launched.
  - A/B testing: split prospects 50/50 between variant A (campaign.template_id)
    and variant B (campaign.ab_template_id_b) at enqueue time.
  - Multiple follow-ups: after a J1 send, schedule all steps from
    ``campaign_follow_ups`` in order.  Falls back to the legacy
    ``follow_up_template_id`` if no ``campaign_follow_ups`` rows exist.
  - Skip sending to prospects who have unsubscribed.
  - Manual queue control: cancel a pending item, or re-queue a skipped one so
    the worker sends it on its next tick.
