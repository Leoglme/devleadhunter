"""Stamp outbound demo/video links with a marketing-channel attribution param.

Each channel that pushes a prospect their demo link tags it with ``?src=<channel>``
(email / sms) so PostHog can attribute the demo visit to the channel it came from
— separate from the A/B ``?v=`` variant. An untagged link (a direct visit or a
bookmark) reads as « direct » on the tracking side.

SMS links take the branded short form instead (``https://host/s/<path>``): the demo
host redirects it to the page with ``?src=sms`` appended, so the SMS shows a clean
link with no visible tracking parameter — the pattern SMS providers recommend —
while the visit still lands attributed to the SMS channel.
