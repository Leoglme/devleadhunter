"""
Website liveness classification for scraped prospect URLs.

A URL on a Google Maps / PagesJaunes listing does not mean the business has a
working website: Google closed every ``business.site`` in March 2024, Solocal
mini-sites die with the subscription, domains expire. Those prospects used to be
excluded by the "no website" filter while being the best possible targets — they
already paid for a website once. This service tells the scrapers which URLs
actually respond.
