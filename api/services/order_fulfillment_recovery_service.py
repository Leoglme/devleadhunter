"""Background recovery for post-payment fulfilment.

Closes the fire-and-forget gap: the Stripe webhook kicks off fulfilment in a
detached task, so if that task dies (server restart, transient Vercel/Storyblok
outage) the paid order would stay silently undelivered. This loop periodically
retries such orders — bounded by ``MAX_FULFILMENT_ATTEMPTS`` and age — so a client
who paid is not left without a site.
