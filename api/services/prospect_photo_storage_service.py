"""Rehost a prospect's enrichment photos onto permanent R2 storage.

Facebook photos are served from ``fbcdn.net`` on **signed URLs that expire within days**, so a demo
site generated a few days after the scrape would fetch a dead link. Two kinds of value reach a durable
R2 home here:

- a base64 ``data:`` URI the desktop scraper captured (the preferred path — bytes grabbed on the
  residential IP while the link was fresh); it is decoded and uploaded, no network needed;
- a raw ``fbcdn``/``scontent`` URL still live — downloaded server-side then uploaded. This recovers a
  photo the scraper left as a URL (older capture, over the cap), and lets a re-hosting pass fix an
  existing enrichment without re-scraping (the user's photo curation is preserved).

Other URLs (a Google photo, an already-rehosted R2 URL) are passed through untouched. Everything is
best-effort — a rehost failure returns the original value so enrichment never breaks over a hiccup.
