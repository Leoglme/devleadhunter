"""Multi-email bounce fallback.

When a campaign email hard-bounces on a prospect's primary address, we don't want to lose the prospect:
if they have another (not-yet-tried) email, promote it to primary and re-queue the same campaign email
to it, scheduled on a normal send slot. Always 1-to-1 — never a multi-recipient send. It stops on its
own once every email has been tried, and never re-sends when a message already reached the prospect.
